# This file contains configuration data for NetworkSpaces.  It must have
# a Python compatible syntax.  Edit the file as necessary, then rename
# to nwsconf.py

# nwsHost: NWS server hostname/IP address.
nwsHost = '192.168.0.5' 

# remoteUser: Remote user name for workers.
#
# Remote workers are launched using passwordless ssh if sleighLauch = 'sshcmd'.
# It is recommended that remoteUser be a limited privilege account with a 
# user name that differs from the account creating this configuration file.  
# Consult the NetworkSpaces manual for details on setting up passwordless ssh.
#
# In addition to setting up passwordless ssh as described in the NWS manual,
# the user must also ensure that the python executable is in the 
# non-interactive ssh path that is established when ssh is used to execute a
# remote command (eg, ssh remoteUser@aNote someCommand).  Because the default,
# non-interactive path is hardcoded into ssh, the python executable may not be
# visible.  To check the ssh PATH run
#    ssh remoteUser@aNode set
# replacing remoteUser with the correct user name, and aNode with the correct
# node name or IP address.  If the path to python is not in PATH as shown
# running the above command, then the user must
#     a) create a symbolic link to the python executable in a valid ssh PATH
#     directory on each machine, or
#     b) create a PATH entry in ~/.ssh/environment on each node (where ~
#     points to the remoteUser home directory) and set PermitUserEnvironment 
#     in sshd_config on each node.  See the man page for sshd_config for more 
#     details. 
remoteUser = 'gridworker'

# sleighLaunch: Lauch method for Sleigh.
#
# Method of starting Sleigh workers.  Valid values are:
#   'local'
#   'sshcmd'
# See the NetworkSpaces documentation on Sleigh for more information.
sleighLaunch = 'sshcmd'

# nodeList: List of remote machines to use for computation.
#
# If sleighLaunch = 'sshcmd', one worker will be created for each 
# hostname/IP address in nodeList.  Therefore if the user wishes to fully 
# utilize a multicore machine, nodeList should contain the hostname/IP 
# address of that multicore machine n-times (where n is the number of cores).
# Note: IP addresses are strings and should be quoted.
#
# nodeList is ignored if sleighLauch = 'local'.  Set workerCount instead.
nodeList = [
    '192.168.0.2',

# workerCount: Number of local workers to use for computation.
#
# If sleighLaunch = 'local', then workerCount workers will be started and
# used for the computation.  workerCount is ignored if sleighLaunch = 'sshcmd'.
workerCount = 2

# loadFactor: Multiplier for number of tasks to submit to workspace at a time.
#
# The number of tasks in the workspace will be loadFactor*len(nodeList) or
# loadFactor*workerCount, depending upon the value of sleighLaunch.
# Consult the NetworkSpaces manual documentation on the eachElem() function
# for more information.
loadFactor = 3

# workingDir: Working directory for workers.
#
# The sleign workers will be initialized to work in this directory.  The
# directory must exist on each node and the workers must have write access to 
# the directory.
