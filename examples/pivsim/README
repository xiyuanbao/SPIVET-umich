The files contained in this directory are example scripts for the pivsim
module.  

- CalTarget2.png: Input image of the grid-like calibration target.  The
  image will be bitmapped onto a rectangular surface that is 'inserted'
  into the syrup.

- simcal.py: Runs the raytracer to generate a sequence of images of a
  grid-like target.  simcal should be run first, and then photogrammetric
  calibration performed using the example calibration script (located
  elsewhere).  After photogrammetric calibration is complete, simb.py
  can be run to do an experiment simulation.

- SimTarget.png: A starscape image that simulates a 2D view of a real
  PIV experiment.  Just as with the CalTarget2.png image, SimTarget.png
  will be bitmapped onto a rectangular surface that is immersed in the
  syrup.

- simb.py: Driver script that generates 4 images (two for each camera) of
  the SimTarget moving a known distance.  These images can then be fed
  to the example pivsfdrv.py script (located elsewhere) to compute
  the uniform displacement field.
