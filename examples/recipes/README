The files contained in this directory demonstrate the primary means of
interacting with SPIVET to reduce raw images into useable flow field
variables.  The files are listed below in the order they are generally run.

- bldsched.py: This recipe takes a list of image files from an experiment
  and generates EFRMLST files which the next recipe uses to actually
  compute flow field variables.

- precipe.py: This recipe is the workhorse.  It is responsible for
  converting raw images into flow field variables.

- sync.py: The sync.py recipe is an example of post-processing that can
  be done to refine the results from precipe.
