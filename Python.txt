gcc from att. research that you recommended

fftw-3.3.1

jpegsrc-v6b: after make install, do make install-lib, and make install-headers

libpng-1.5.9

freetype-2.4.8

netcdf-4.1.3: I don't have hdf5 installed, so I had to disable that via a flag to configure.

readline-6.2: ./configure -disable-shared

install lapack (whatever the latest version is).

atlas-3.8.4: don't build with make -j3 (just use make).  If fail with some error that a file isn't found, type make again.  

python-2.7.2.  I built with --enable-framework.  That's the only flag passed to configure.

Make sure /usr/local/bin is first in path (put
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
in your .profile file.  Then open a new terminal window.)

nose-1.1.2

install numpy-1.6.1, test (ignore failures on nan)

export FFLAGS="-ff2c", install scipy-0.10.1, test.  There should be no failures that aren't already known.

close out that terminal and open a new one.

install PIL (Imaging-1.1.7).

install matplotlib-1.1.0.  For this build, you need to first
    cp setup.cfg.template setup.cfg
then edit setup.cfg.  Under [directories], put
    basedirlist = /usr /usr/local
then build and install.
